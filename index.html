            <h1>Welcome to Brianna's Feed!</h1>
            <p>[DRAFT: This will hold text about the feed] 'The Feed' was the first major project created for in ART 272 in Jan-Feb 2024.</p>
            <p>The goal of the project was to help learn & practice the basics of HTML/CSS, typesetting for the screen, and this project aimed to create an understanding of the way that digital media and networks play a role in our lives at this time.</p>
            <p>This project was partially created using a chrome extension called <em>Glance Back</em>. Glance Back is a chrome extension that acts as a daily photo diary, capturing the moments shared between the user and their computer.</p>
            <p>Once a day, when the user opens a new tab, Glance Back will unexpectedly take their photo, ask them what they're thinking about, and save both the photo and written thought to its locally stored archive.</p>
            <p>The following photos are the result of approximately <strong>a week</strong>of using Glance Back.</p>
