        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>I usually use the internet for "window shopping" or just pursuing my creative interests; be it browsing inspiration on Pinterest or working on an actual project like writing on my blog.</p>
        <p>In the screenshot captioned, "should i do an inbox cleanse", I was doing what takes a lot of my time which is managing my school and work responsibilities. In another photo captioned, "my Amazon package is otw!!!", it was proof of one of my many window shopping escapades coming to fruition. Another photo captioned, "could use a nap about now", I was at work where a lot of my responsibilities are carried out using the internet. I use it at work for a lot of record-keeping and connecting with others online.</p>
        <p>My hope for the internet is that we return to the 'wild west' nature that the internet had in which we were all solely in control of our experiences on the web. I think right now, it is a wild west in the most deteriorative way. We use it a lot more to attack each other now or shove information and opinion into each other's heads. Communities are less wholesome and welcoming than I believe they started out online.</p>

        <p>Life online, at least in the context of myself, are definitely different when it comes to transparency and the level of polished-ness that is presented, but they aren't completely disconnected. The people I share; the pictures I post; the feelings I try to convey, they are real. They have happened and they are all truly part of my experience, but they are not the entirety and I don't believe that our online selves should ever reveal our entirety.</p>
